Hello and welcome to my blackjack simulator! Those is a card counting program that uses the 
Optimal Blackjack Strategy Table to guide the game. The program also uses an approximation of game state
and potential deck quantity and therefore card quantity to determine potential deviations in optimization.

The goal of this project is to determine accuracy of deck approximation and variation from strategy, in as few cards as possible.
